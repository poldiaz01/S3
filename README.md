## Exercise 1

The aim of this task is to do a conversion of a resized video into differents codecs; VP8, VP9, h265 and AV1. I have take the 480p video and I have done all the corresponding conversions, named as ex1_vp8.webm, ex1_vp9.webm, ex_1_h265.mp4 and ex_1.av1.mkv
Once the 4 videos have been obtained, I create a new video which is it a mosaic made up of the previous 4. This one is called  mosaic.mkv.

By considering different bitrates from each video converted, I have analysed that 


## Exercise 2

I have created a video converter program. The application works as follow: You can choose the video file that you want to convert in the button 'Open a File'. Then, you can press the 4 different buttons and the conversion would be done and the resulting video converted would be saved in the same folder where you have take the video input. For closing the application, you have to click the button 'QUIT'
